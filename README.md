# Supply-Management-System-using-JavaFX-and-MySQL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Project involves creating a software application that manages and tracks the flow of goods and materials within an organization. 
The project would likely include the following features:

### User Interface: The application would have a user-friendly interface, designed using JavaFX, that allows employees to easily navigate and input data.

### Inventory Management: The system would have the ability to track inventory levels, record new stock arrivals, and generate reports on inventory status.

### Order Management: The system would allow employees to place and track orders for goods and materials, as well as manage and approve purchase orders.

### Supplier Management: The system would have a database of suppliers and their contact information, and allow employees to manage and track supplier performance.

### Data Persistence: The system would use a MySQL database to store and retrieve information entered by the users, such as inventory, orders, and supplier data.

Overall, this project demonstrates the ability to design and develop a comprehensive supply management system that utilizes JavaFX for the user
interface, and MySQL for data persistence and reporting. This project will showcase my the knowledge in the areas of 
software development, database management, and project management.
